# 🤖 Personalized Linux AI Assistant (Powered by Gemini + LangChain)

This project is a **natural language Linux assistant** — a Python-based AI agent that can understand plain English and automatically **execute real shell commands** on your system.

Just *tell it what you want*, and it does the work.

✅ *“Create a folder called server and two files ap and pa”*  
✅ *“Show me RAM and disk usage”*  
✅ *“Install and start Apache server”* — *(Yes, it installs and enables Apache without typing a single yum/systemctl command!)*
